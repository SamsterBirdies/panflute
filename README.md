# panflute
Bamboo pan flute 22 pipes in G major scale recorded with a Blue Yeti. The recorded samples range from B3 to E6. Anything outside that range uses the nearest sample.

I wasn't able to find a pan flute sound font on the internets (at least one with more than a single sample), so I decided to record one I had laying around.
This is my first sound font, don't expect professional quality, but it should be operational enough. Modulators probably don't work because I don't understand how they work.
Created with Polyphonme.
